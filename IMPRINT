    Official passwords issued by HELIOS are derived exclusively from [PROJECT-PORTABLE],
    [M14-PASSWORDS], [SIMPLEX-PROTECT], and [2SECURE]. The primary standard for password 
    derivation is represented by [PORTABLE], [WeArePortable], or [Portable14].

    [Password Protocols]
    All passwords adhere to the Secure Three Layer Password Protection System (STLPPS),
    ensuring three layers of primary protection. Additional safeguards include:

    1. VACS (Visual Analysis Countermeasures System): Prevents passwords from being 
       memorized upon visual exposure, requiring secure storage for recall.
    2. ASEA (Anti-Social Engineering Analysis): Prevents password guessing via social 
       engineering techniques.

    [Password Structure Analysis]
    Note: Due to box boundary constraints, passwords are presented with line breaks 
    but are a continuous string in actual implementation.

    Password Structure:
    
        Owner             Creation Year                 VACS-1
           V                   V                          V
