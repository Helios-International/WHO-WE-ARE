    Passwords that are OFFICIALLY by helios will always derive from [PROJECT-PORTABLE],
    [M14-PASSWORDS], [SIMPLEX-PROTECT], and [2SECURE]. 
    The primary derivation for passwords created by helios will always be represented 
    by [PORTABLE] or [WeArePortable] or [Portable14].

    [password/info]
    All built under the primary ruleset, STLPPS. (Secure Three Layer Password Protection
    System). This ruleset ensures that passwords have three layers of primary protection
    integrated. 

    All built under the secondary ruleset, VACS. (Visual Analysis Countermeasures System). 
    This ruleset ensures that passwords that are visibily viewed cannot be memorized whatsoever
    therefor requiring them to be noted in order to know the password. 

    All built under the tertiary ruleset, ASEA. (Anti Social Engineering Analysis). 
    This ruleset ensures that passwords cannot be formed or guessed through the process of 
    "social engineering". 

    [passwords/structure-analysis]

    // note: the password is all one line, due to box boundaries we must make a new line
             however in reality this is note the case
