// WHO IS HELIOS 

hi, im helios. 

let's start with my story... 

2021. let's talk about SHARECLOUD. so what actually is SHARECLOUD? image-hosting software. 
it was not very popular (7000 MAUs). it only lasted like 5 months? rough 

2022. is where it started. legit had zero sense on what i was doing w/ life, peeked 
a record of 100 hours per week on roblox? (da hood to be specfic). wtf was i doing...

now this is where it all begins. OBLIVITY. wtf is that? the most dominant "script" 
for da hood at the time. powered by old-time executors and protected by luauth
i suppose none of that fancy software cmd line bullshit was apparent at the time. 

anyway, back to the story. oblivity was peaking across the game, desync and 
anti-lock was revolutionary. no other paid script could beat it which was 
crazy to me. 

so 13 year old me decided to contact the owner, with the following words 
"yo bro can i invest?". 7 hours later, over 250 EUR was invested in the 
development. later i got offered a position to manage the community. 

now, dhcom at 2022 was only the start of what 2025 is right now, and i 
for sure can say that 2021 from expereince was the peaktime for its existance 

but it opened a vision for me and i can fs say that it may be the reason 
why this all exists.
