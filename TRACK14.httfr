This document outlines the purpose and functionality of TRACK14. All details provided are subject to change at any time.

> What is TRACK14?
TRACK14 (also known as we4trackr) is a tracking agent specifically designed to monitor user activity through private intelligence. 
In simpler terms, this means the user must explicitly grant access to tracking systems via their devices or through embedded pixels.
TRACK14 can track activity across multiple platforms, including:
Social Media: Discord, Snapchat, TikTok, Instagram
Devices: PCs, Consoles, Android (iOS is not supported)
Gaming Platforms: Minecraft, RUST, ROBLOX, Steam, PSN, Xbox
TRACK14 does not continuously monitor usage. Instead, it compiles data from multiple sources to determine the latest known activity of a tracked individual, ensuring an optimal and efficient tracking report.

> What is RPG? (Rustsussy Preservation Group)
RPG is the management group consisting of three individuals responsible for preserving content related to Rustsussy. Their responsibilities include:
Protecting sensitive content
Archiving text logs, video clips, calls, transcripts, and more
Managing long-term digital preservation for memory or project-related purposes
As of April 22, 2025, RPG maintains a data archive of approximately 18.1 TB.

> What is HDS? (Helios Distribution System)
HDS works alongside TRACK14 through a dedicated Helios-specific agent known as STARLIGHT. This system ensures real-world safety checks by verifying whether Helios (the individual) is still alive.
Key features:
A monthly check-in call is scheduled.
If the call is missed, an emergency alert is sent to designated contacts.
A 7-day grace period is enforced before automatic distribution is triggered.
If the emergency condition is confirmed, HDS activates the secure distribution of Helios digital content to pre-approved recipients, as determined solely by Helios.

> What is HI? (Helios International)
Helios International, also referred to as HISC, is currently undisclosed. No public information can be provided at this time.
